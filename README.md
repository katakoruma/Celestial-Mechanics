### Synodic period 

This program determines the synodic period for any number of objects with arbitrary orbital periods (e.g. the 8 planets in our solar system)
For 2 objects this can be calculated analytically, however for more than 2 objects iit must be simulated.


### Planet around 2 black holes

This program plots the path of a planet that revolves around 2 close to each other and fast revolving around each other black holes.
Because of their tidal forces the planet becomes affected and will be flung away after some time.
